CROWN-STANDARD INTEGRITY PROOF
SOVERAIN VERIFICATION BUNDLE — VERSION 1.0

This document affirms the integrity of the SOVERAIN Verification Bundle by
providing a verifiable record of the files, their expected locations, and the
checksum algorithm used for validation.

Bundle Name: SOVERAIN Verification Bundle
Version: 1.0
Checksum Algorithm: SHA-256

Files Covered by Integrity Verification:
- identity/sovereign-identity.json
- verification/manifest.json
- verification/checksums.json
- verification/pointer.json
- qr/qr-metadata.json

Purpose:
This integrity proof ensures that any system, auditor, or verification crawler
can confirm that the files in the SOVERAIN Verification Bundle have not been
altered, replaced, or corrupted.

Verification Procedure:
1. Retrieve the SOVERAIN Verification Bundle from the repository root.
2. Read verification/checksums.json.
3. Compute SHA-256 hashes for each file listed.
4. Compare computed hashes to the values stored in checksums.json.
5. If all values match, the bundle is verified as authentic and unmodified.

This document is part of the public verification layer and may be used by
wallets, ENS resolvers, QR systems, and matrix-level identity crawlers.
